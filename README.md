# Kraken Realtime Alerts (Minimal Scaffold)

This is a minimal, CSP-safe Vite + React scaffold to ensure your Netlify deploy works and the ZIP download is valid.
It fetches XBTUSD once from Kraken REST and renders a basic status + logs panel.

## Deploy (Netlify)
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Build command: `npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build`

## Dev
npm install
npm run dev

## Build
npm run build
